    <p>
      My name is Jonas Fleenor. I am a prospecting Software Developer studying Computer Science at Rose-Hulman:
      Institute of Technology. I developed an interest in computers during middle school by watching my father program
      websites. I began to study these topics and took courses as my school introduced them and have been hooked ever
      since!
    </p>
    <p>
      My pass-times include reading fantasy novels, watching adventure movies or tv-shows, and spending quality time
      with those close to me. I have a deep love for The Lord of the Rings and all things Tolkien, as well as for
      table-top boardgames like Dungeons and Dragons!
